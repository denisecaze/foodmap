# Foodmap
A website that finds restaurants nearby. 

## Motivation
It was a challenge of the third sprint of Laboratoria bootcamp. The requirement was to create a site with a breakpoint of 576px where it would be possible to locate some specific restaurants located in the surrounds of Paulista Avenue, in São Paulo - SP, using Google's API. The restaurants suggested for this exercise were accessed through an internal database.
